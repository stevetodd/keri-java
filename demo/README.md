# Demo Module

This module is designed to interact with the keripy demo module as a sort of interoperability test.
It will likely get deleted in the short to medium term.

This is also a playground for experimenting various technologies for the server and client
implementations. In short, don't expect good-looking code or for this to be the final form of
things.
